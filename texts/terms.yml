  CORE is a not-for-profit open scholarly infrastructure service
  dedicated to the open access and open science mission and a
  subscriber to the [Principles of Open Scholarly Infrastructures
  (POSI)](https://openscholarlyinfrastructure.org/posse/). It
  provides a comprehensive bibliographic database of the world’s
  scholarly literature, indexing research from Data Providers,
  including repositories, journals and other scholarly sources.
  CORE serves the global network of repositories and journals
  increasing discoverability and preventing misuse of their
  content; making metadata records uniquely identifiable and
  resolvable with decentralised PIDs; supporting data providers in
  adopting good practices by providing tools for metadata
  validation, content management, enrichment and Open Access
  compliance; and facilitating machine access to open research.


  CORE is a [Community Governed](https://core.ac.uk/governance)
  service where [Supporting and Sustaining
  Members](https://core.ac.uk/membership) participate in service
  governance.


  By setting up a member account with CORE, the Data Provider
  grants CORE permission to process and use data made publicly
  available by the Data Provider’s systems ( repository(ies) and
  journal(s) registered in CORE) within CORE’s services.


  The Data Provider also grants permission to CORE to process
  user-generated data, including personal data, such as email
  addresses, entered by the Data Provider within the CORE
  Dashboard, to run the CORE Dashboard service and supply the
  identified individuals with information relevant to the
  operation and indexing of the Data Provider’s systems, such as
  informing them about the indexing status, OA compliance,
  metadata enrichment and validation of their systems. CORE will
  not supply such information to third parties or use it for
  third-party marketing. Data Providers may request their data to
  be removed at any time.


  The Data Provider understands that indexing the supplied content does not constitute approval or
  endorsement of such content by CORE. The Data Provider may at
  any point submit take-down requests for the removal of any
  scholarly content it supplied to CORE directly from the CORE
  Dashboard. CORE may unilaterally remove any content supplied by
  the Data Provider that may be found to violate the copyright of
  other parties, be perceived as harmful or offensive by some
  users.
