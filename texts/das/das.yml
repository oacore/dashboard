    The below list contains the list of papers in your repository for which CORE has automatically detected the presence of Data Availability statements.  We recommend that you review the automatically extracted Data Availability statements to check if they are correct. You will be then able to download a .csv file which contains these reviewed Data Availability statements, for instance for the purposes of importing this information into your repository. The Data Availability statements identification runs on your full texts, CORE cannot detect Data Availability statements from papers CORE doesn’t have access to.

    * “**Review Data Availability Statement**”: click on the Review Data Availability Statement link. A pop-up will show up displaying the automatically extracted Data Availability Statement. Review it and click on correct or wrong.

    * “**Status**”: this indicates whether the Data Availability statement has been reviewed and found correct or wrong. Data Availability statements that have not been reviewed will be indicated by a question mark.
