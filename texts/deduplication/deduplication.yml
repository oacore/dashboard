title: Find versions and near-duplicates

description: Our technology searches your repository to identify different versions of your articles and potential duplicates within your repository. This can help you in managing and curating your repository content. We periodically detect near-duplicate records and versions and allow you to compare them side by side. This can help you improve your repository metadata and keep the repository clean. When investigating the detected matches, you can mark them either as duplicates, different version or not the same article. This advises CORE how to index them. Please note that it is not possible to delete or merge duplicates in your repository directly from this dashboard. However, you can use this tool to identify these potential issues and then resolve them in a way that is supported by your specific repository platform. Matches can be downloaded in a .csv format.

  info: We perform a check for versions and near-duplicates periodically, every time we complete the harvesting of your repository. We match records using a variant of locality sensitive hashing.
  listOfDuplicates: The below list includes all the records in your repository for which we found at least one other match. Click on any of the records to inspect and compare it with all the other matching records.

    The below list contains the potential duplicates which CORE identified. You can compare them to this record and review how they differ. You can subsequently mark them as “to be removed” or “different from the reference paper”.

    * **“To be removed”**: this indicates that one of the other presented records in the repository are the same as this record. You decided to mark this record as the one to be removed.

    * **“Different from the reference paper”**: this indicates that this record is not related to the reference paper. You decided to disassociate this record from the reference paper. This will remove the connection of this record from the reference Works entity.

      When you mark a paper as “to be removed” or “different from the reference paper”, then this marking will be exporter in a .csv format when you download the data using the download button.

      When you mark a paper as different from the reference paper, then this will impact how CORE displays this article in Search, API and other services. Specifically, this article will be disassociated from the reference Work entity.
  tableTitle: Possible duplicates in your repositories
  duplicates: This column contains the version classification of the paper. The paper can be marked as a duplicate, or as a version with the type defined by one of the possible values in the COAR version type vocabulary
  publicationDate: The publication date coming from the repository metadata.
