title: Deduplication

description: Our technology searches your repository to identify potential duplicates. Please note that it is not possible to delete or merge duplicates in your repository directly from the dashboard. However, you can either resolve duplicates in your repository manually with the help of this tool or download the identified duplicates in a .csv format and use it to clean your data using a script you develop.

You can compare and review these potential duplicates and confirm them as duplicates or tell us that they are different. This will impact how CORE displays these articles in Search, API and other services. Specifically, by marking potential duplicates as different articles, these articles will be disassociated (they will not be part of the same **Work** entity).
