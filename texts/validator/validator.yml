title: RIOXX metadata validator

description: This metadata validator helps you to assess how well your metadata comply with RIOXX and provide recommendations on improving this compliance.

rioxInfo: The validator works for both [RIOXX v2](https://www.rioxx.net/profiles/v2-0-rc-2/) and [RIOXX v3](https://www.rioxx.net/profiles/v3-0-rc-1/). You can input a sample RIOXX record into the below text field to see how it complies with RIOXX. Where issues are detected, we provide recommendations to help you improve your metadata quality.  While we are encouraging everybody to migrate to RIOXXv3, keep in mind that RIOXX v3 is as of 1st April 2023 still in the Release Candidate 1 version and some of the recommendations might change when the final version is released.

             <dc:description>A week-long intensive process of staff development and induction called Rapid Institutional Appraisal (RIA) was conducted in November 2000 in the Systems Discipline, Centre for Complexity and Change (CCC), at the Open University. We report the systemic roots and characteristics of the RIA as designed from traditions of soft systems methodology and rapid rural appraisal. Our experiences arising from our own use of RIA are described and the wider implications for organizational learning in a complex organization discussed. While acknowledging limitations with this RIA event, we argue that RIA offers a potential model for staff development for adaptive use in different contexts and on varying scales. The process builds on principles of "conversation" and "multiple perspectives" as the touchstone for establishing a purposeful community of practice.</dc:description>
