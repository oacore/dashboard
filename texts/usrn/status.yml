    title: Free and Easy Discoverability & Access
    description: |
      The repository provides broad, equitable, and maximally open access to
      resources and their metadata in both machine- and human-readable formats at no
      cost to users. This should be done in a timely manner after submission and with
      limited unscheduled downtime, consistent with legal and policy requirements.
      The repository’s content should be discoverable both within the repository
      (i.e., via a search interface) and externally (i.e., via discovery services and
      aggregators). The repository supports access to its content for persons with
      disabilities and adheres to current web accessibility standards. Provide an
      accessibility statement describing efforts to increase accessibility of the
      platform/content and how to seek help if an accessible version of a digital
      publication is not available.

    title: Your repository supports OAI-PMH
    description: |
      The Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (referred to as the OAI-PMH in
      the remainder of this document) provides an application-independent interoperability
      framework based on metadata harvesting. This provides the basic building block to provide an
      interoperable digital publications repository.
      OAI-PMH is the most widely used protocol for exchanging information between repositories.
      It is the standard used by CERN, by arXiv, by Wikipedia, by repository software tools such as DSpace and ePrints, and by CORE.

      Repository managers can check their OAI-PMH endpoint using the [OAI-PMH Validator tool](https://www.openarchives.org/Register/ValidateSite).

    description: |
      The number of records CORE is able to index from your digital repository. If this number doesn't match your records
      it might mean you have issues in exposing your records in an interoperable way.
      The [Indexing status tab](/harvesting) provides a summary of any issue CORE finds while indexing your repository.
      A common issue is when institutions have more than one repository. CORE identifies some but not all of the repositories, which means the total number it identifies is less than the total in the repositories.

    description: |
      The number of full text CORE is able to discover from your digital repository. If this number doesn't match your records
      it might mean you have issues in exposing your records in an interoperable way.
      You can check the [Harvesting tab](/harvesting) where we collect issues CORE discovered while indexing your repository.
      If this number doesn't match your records it might mean you have issues in exposing your records in an interoperable way.
      The [Indexing status tab](/harvesting) provides a summary of any issue CORE finds while indexing your repository.
      CORE requires that full text must be hosted on the same domain or subdomains as the OAI-PMH endpoint, unless we are informed by the institution about other owned domains containing full text.

    description: |
      The repository ensures metadata records for resources include licensing information
      stipulating reuse conditions. Ideally, machine-readable information on the OA
      status with the license is embedded in the resource.

      Percent of metadata records with a licence specified:
    recommendation: |
      Licensing and copyright information may be displayed  in a machine-readable way, or by a text description. However, text descriptions such as “all rights reserved” may not be specific enough for other users to interpret. Much better is to provide a URL to the relevant Creative Common licence, for example, for the non-commercial CC-BY licence, https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/
      By clicking on this link, a human can see the precise meaning of this licence. Any machine can identify immediately, and unambiguously, what kind of licence is stated.
      CORE promotes and advocates for the use of machine-readable licencing descriptions. In particular, we advise the use of the NISO Access License and Indicators (ALI) Schema.
      Institutions may have a blanket policy that covers all content with a specific publisher, which usually means that individual documents contain no licensing information. However, a specific CC-BY licence enables exceptions to be made for individual documents and reduces ambiguity.
  - id: uniquePersistentIdentifiers

    type: text
    title: Unique Persistent Identifiers
    description: |
      The repository assigns each resource a unique persistent identifier (PID),
      such as a digital object identifier (DOI), to support discovery, citation, reporting (e.g., of research progress),
      and research assessment (e.g., identifying the outputs of Federally funded research). The unique PID points to a
      persistent location that remains accessible even if the content is de-accessioned or no longer available.
      The repository supports PIDs for entities related to the resources, such as authors (e.g., ORCID), funders
      (e.g., Funder Registry), and organizations (e.g., ROR).

    type: statistic
    title: Links to research datasets
    description: |
      Links to research data are often shown with a URL, but much better is to use a persistent data identifier, such as a DOI,
      with the research data held in a trusted repository, which may be the same as your institutional repository,
      or may be a separate repository specifically for data, which is maintained by your repository team.

    title: Do you provide data accessibility statements
    description: |
      A data availability statement also sometimes called a ‘data access statement’, tells the reader where the research
      data associated with a paper is available, and under what conditions the data can be accessed.
      They also include links where applicable to the data set.
      For example, the paper may state “The data that support the findings of this study are openly available in [repository name] at https://doi.org/[doi]”.
      This is in development right now.

    title: ORCID
    description: |
      Public Investigator and Contributor Identifier is a non-proprietary alphanumeric code that uniquely identifies scientific authors.
      ORCID is an essential metadata tool that enables researchers to claim credit for their own research, without ambiguity.
      For example, there are many researchers with the common name “John Smith” or “Zhang Wei”. ORCID enables these names to be disambiguated
      CORE is currently developing an ORCID dashboard, which will enable repository managers to both to identify missing ORCID IDs,
      and to enrich your data with ORCID IDs found from elsewhere.
      This feature is currently under development.

    description: |
      The repository ensures publications are accompanied by metadata to enable discovery, reuse, and citation,
      using schema that are appropriate to, and ideally widely used across, the communities that the repository serves.
      Metadata for the resource is recorded in a standard, interoperable, non-proprietary format. The repository
      assigns a CC0 public domain license to all metadata for resources in the repository.

    title: FAIR Signposting
    description: |
      FAIR Signposting is a technical approach designed to enhance the discoverability and interoperability
      of scholarly resources on the web. It involves using standardized HTTP link relations to expose key information
      about web resources, particularly in the context of scholarly communication. This approach aligns with the broader
      FAIR principles, which aim for data to be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable.
      Specifically, the HTTP header can contain a <link> element to describe the type of content resource, for example, “author”, or “collection”. .

    title: Use of COAR vocabularies
    description: |
      [COAR (Confederation of Open Access Repositories)](https://vocabularies.coar-repositories.org/) vocabularies are structured sets of terms organized to provide
      a common framework for the sharing and integration of data across different systems.
      They comprise three types: Access rights, resource types, and version types.
      A metadata profile such as RIOXX can provide an easy way to share and use COAR vocabularies in your metadata.
      - Access rights describe the access status of a resource, such as “embargoed access”, or “restricted access”.
      - Resource types describe the type of resource, such as “patent”, “bibliography”, or “conference presentation”.
      - Version types distinguish the various states of an academic article, including the version of record (VOR), the Author’s Original (AO), and the Author’s Accepted Manuscript (AM).
    prefix: |
  - id: embargoedDocuments
    isEnable: yes
    type: statistic
    title: Do you label embargoed documents?
    description: |
      Embargoed documents are articles that can only be made available open access after a stated interval, such as 90 days or six months.
      These delays are best managed when the embargo is tagged in a machine-readable way to ensure that machines can access and understand the policy.
    prefix: |
      Percentage of embargoed documents:
    recommendation: |
      There are various supported ways of tagging an embargo document, CORE recognises only a few of them.
      The [Rioxx specification](https://rioxx.net/profiles/v3-0-final/) recommend that they are tagged using “HTTP status 451 Unavailable For Legal Reasons”. https://rioxx.net/profiles/v3-0-final/
      If this number doesn't match the one in your records please review your system.

    description: |
      The repository provides a landing page for each digital object that includes metadata required for citation of
      the object and provides this metadata in a machine-readable format. The repository collects and shares usage
      information using a standard protocol. The repository offers an API to facilitate machine action and bulk sharing.

    title: Download statistic (IRUS)
    description: |
      IRUS (Institutional Repository Usage Statistics) allows you to demonstrate the value and impact of your institutional
      repository (IR). It does this by enabling institutional repositories to share
      and compare usage statistics based on the COUNTER standard.
    recommendation: |
      These statistics are available using the Irus statistics aggregation service (Irus-US for the USA, and Irus-UK for the UK).
      By using a standard set of statistics, it becomes possible to provide meaningful stats to compare downloads across several repositories.
      Irus uses the [COUNTER](https://www.countermetrics.org/) standard to measure usage statistics, such as “journal request”, or “book usage”.

    isEnable: yes
    type: statistic
    title: Your repository metadata supports a widely used Application Profile
    description: |
      Ensuring the usuage of a well-known application profile means that the metadata of the publication is described
      in a less ambiguous and more accurate way. Most used publications profiles are the OpenAIRE Guidelines 3.0+ and the
      RIOXX metadata application profile.
