    title: Free and Easy Discoverability & Access
    description: |
      The repository provides broad, equitable, and maximally open access to
      resources and their metadata in both machine- and human-readable formats at no
      cost to users. This should be done in a timely manner after submission and with
      limited unscheduled downtime, consistent with legal and policy requirements.
      The repository’s content should be discoverable both within the repository
      (i.e., via a search interface) and externally (i.e., via discovery services and
      aggregators). The repository supports access to its content for persons with
      disabilities and adheres to current web accessibility standards. Provide an
      accessibility statement describing efforts to increase accessibility of the
      platform/content and how to seek help if an accessible version of a digital
      publication is not available.

      The repository has a plan in place to ensure the long-term management and preservation
      of publications and provides documentation of that plan. The management plan
      should include provisions for maintaining integrity, authenticity, and availability.
      The repository records basic preservation metadata including provenance, date of
      upload, and file format.

    title: Unique Persistent Identifiers
    description: |
      The repository assigns each resource a unique persistent identifier (PID),
      such as a digital object identifier (DOI), to support discovery, citation, reporting (e.g., of research progress),
      and research assessment (e.g., identifying the outputs of Federally funded research). The unique PID points to a
      persistent location that remains accessible even if the content is de-accessioned or no longer available.
      The repository supports PIDs for entities related to the resources, such as authors (e.g., ORCID), funders
      (e.g., Funder Registry), and organizations (e.g., ROR).

      assigns a CC0 public domain license to all metadata for resources in the repository.
