titleFirst: USRN Desirable Characteristics of Digital Publication Repositories Report
descriptionFirst: This report should give a live view of the status of the repository against a series of principles defined as
  ["Desirable Characteristics"](https://sparcopen.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Desirable-Characteristics-of-Digital-Publication-Repositories-APPROVED-20230331.pdf)
  and it should support and serve as a companion to the [Toolkit](https://github.com/antleaf/USRN-Discovery/wiki/Toolkit) created by the USRN Discovery project.

    title: Free and Easy Discoverability & Access
    description: |
      The repository provides broad, equitable, and maximally open access to
      resources and their metadata in both machine- and human-readable formats at no
      cost to users. This should be done in a timely manner after submission and with
      limited unscheduled downtime, consistent with legal and policy requirements.
      The repository’s content should be discoverable both within the repository
      (i.e., via a search interface) and externally (i.e., via discovery services and
      aggregators). The repository supports access to its content for persons with
      disabilities and adheres to current web accessibility standards. Provide an
      accessibility statement describing efforts to increase accessibility of the
      platform/content and how to seek help if an accessible version of a digital
      publication is not available.

    description: |
      The Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (referred to as the OAI-PMH in
      the remainder of this document) provides an application-independent interoperability
      framework based on metadata harvesting. This provides the basic building block to provide an
      interoperable digital publications repository.

      The number of records CORE is able to index from your digital repository. If this number doesn't match your records
      it might mean you have issues in exposing your records in an interoperable way.
      You can check the [Harvesting tab](/harvesting) where we collect issues CORE discovered while indexing your repository.

    title: Clear Use Guidance
    description: |
      The repository ensures metadata records for resources include licensing information
      stipulating reuse conditions. Ideally, machine-readable information on the OA
      status with the license is embedded in the resource.

    recommendation: |
      It is important that licenses are exposed correctly in the metadata. The best way is to use well known URLs like for example the Creative Commons canonical URL https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/

    description: |
      The repository has a plan in place to ensure the long-term management and preservation
      of publications and provides documentation of that plan. The management plan
      should include provisions for maintaining integrity, authenticity, and availability.
      The repository records basic preservation metadata including provenance, date of
      upload, and file format.

      The repository has publicly available policies that outline the plan for its long-term management and funding,
      naming the organization responsible for its governance and continued management, and
      containing provisions for cessation of service. The host organization funds staff to support the repository and
      its users and publicly provides contact information for at least one individual charged with assisting users
      and the explicit responsibility of managing the repository services.

    title: Unique Persistent Identifiers
    description: |
      The repository assigns each resource a unique persistent identifier (PID),
      such as a digital object identifier (DOI), to support discovery, citation, reporting (e.g., of research progress),
      and research assessment (e.g., identifying the outputs of Federally funded research). The unique PID points to a
      persistent location that remains accessible even if the content is de-accessioned or no longer available.
      The repository supports PIDs for entities related to the resources, such as authors (e.g., ORCID), funders
      (e.g., Funder Registry), and organizations (e.g., ROR).

    description: |
      A data availability statement also sometimes called a ‘data access statement’, tells the reader where the research
      data associated with a paper is available, and under what conditions the data can be accessed.
      They also include links where applicable to the data set.
      This is in development right now.

      FAIR Signposting is a technical approach designed to enhance the discoverability and interoperability
      of scholarly resources on the web. It involves using standardized HTTP link relations to expose key information
      about web resources, particularly in the context of scholarly communication. This approach aligns with the broader
      FAIR principles, which aim for data to be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable.
