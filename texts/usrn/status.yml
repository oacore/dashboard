titleSecond: Free and Easy Discoverability & Access
descriptionSecond: The repository provides broad, equitable, and maximally open access to resources and their metadata in both machine- and human-readable formats at no cost to users. This should be done in a timely manner after submission and with limited unscheduled downtime, consistent with legal and policy requirements. The repositoryâ€™s content should be discoverable both within the repository (i.e., via a search interface) and externally (i.e., via discovery services and aggregators). The repository supports access to its content for persons with disabilities and adheres to current web accessibility standards. Provide an accessibility statement describing efforts to increase accessibility of the platform/content and how to seek help if an accessible version of a digital publication is not available.
