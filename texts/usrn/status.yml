    title: Free and Easy Discoverability & Access
    description: |
      The repository provides broad, equitable, and maximally open access to
      resources and their metadata in both machine- and human-readable formats at no
      cost to users. This should be done in a timely manner after submission and with
      limited unscheduled downtime, consistent with legal and policy requirements.
      The repositoryâ€™s content should be discoverable both within the repository
      (i.e., via a search interface) and externally (i.e., via discovery services and
      aggregators). The repository supports access to its content for persons with
      disabilities and adheres to current web accessibility standards. Provide an
      accessibility statement describing efforts to increase accessibility of the
      platform/content and how to seek help if an accessible version of a digital
      publication is not available.

    title: Clear Use Guidance
    description: |
      The repository ensures metadata records for resources include licensing information
      stipulating reuse conditions. Ideally, machine-readable information on the OA
      status with the license is embedded in the resource.

    title: Preservation
    description: |
      The repository has a plan in place to ensure the long-term management and preservation
      of publications and provides documentation of that plan. The management plan
      should include provisions for maintaining integrity, authenticity, and availability.
      The repository records basic preservation metadata including provenance, date of
      upload, and file format.

    title: Long-term Organizational Sustainability
    description: |
      The repository has publicly available policies that outline the plan for its long-term management and funding,
      naming the organization responsible for its governance and continued management, and
      containing provisions for cessation of service. The host organization funds staff to support the repository and
      its users and publicly provides contact information for at least one individual charged with assisting users
      and the explicit responsibility of managing the repository services.

  - id: uniquePersistentIdentifiers
    type: text
    title: Unique Persistent Identifiers
    description: |
      The repository assigns each resource a unique persistent identifier (PID),
      such as a digital object identifier (DOI), to support discovery, citation, reporting (e.g., of research progress),
      and research assessment (e.g., identifying the outputs of Federally funded research). The unique PID points to a
      persistent location that remains accessible even if the content is de-accessioned or no longer available.
      The repository supports PIDs for entities related to the resources, such as authors (e.g., ORCID), funders
      (e.g., Funder Registry), and organizations (e.g., ROR).

    title: Metadata
    description: |
      The repository ensures publications are accompanied by metadata to enable discovery, reuse, and citation,
      using schema that are appropriate to, and ideally widely used across, the communities that the repository serves.
      Metadata for the resource is recorded in a standard, interoperable, non-proprietary format. The repository
      assigns a CC0 public domain license to all metadata for resources in the repository.
