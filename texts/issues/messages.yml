- type: ATTACHMENT_TITLE_MISMATCH
  severity: WARNING
  trigger: |
    We check that the pdf contains the title provided in the metadata.
    If the first 50 lines of the pdf do not contain an exact match of the title OR is similar.
  title: Title in the metadata doesn't match the full text
  description: |
    To ensure we link the correct metadata and full text, we check that the
    metadata title text is contained within the full text.

    An exact match is not required, but must be similar.

    This issue is common and can be ignored for  scanned documents,
    where Optical Character Recognition (OCR) has not been performed
    and articles with special characters in their title.

    Ensure that the Metadata Title is the same as the document title or
    include a link to the full text in `dc:identifier` (if you use Dublin Core)
    or follow the RIOXX or OpenAIREv4.1 specifications.
  resolution: |
    Ensure that the Metadata Title is the same as the document title. For example:

    Failed match example:
        - `dc:title:` _An Open Access Paper: a study_
        - PDF title: _A study of Open Access Papers_

    A successful partial match:
        - `dc:title`: _A study of Open Access Papers in Europe_
        - PDF title: _Studying Open Access papers in Europe_

    The closer the match, the more likely we will accept the change.

    You may bypass this check by including a link to the full text in `dc:identifier`.
