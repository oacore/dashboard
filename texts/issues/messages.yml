  description: |
    To ensure we link the correct metadata and full text, we check that the

    This issue is common and can be ignored for  scanned documents,
    where Optical Character Recognition&nbsp;(OCR) has not been performed
    and articles with special characters in their title.

    Ensure that the Metadata Title is the same as the document title or
    include a link to the full text in `dc:identifier` (if you use Dublin Core)
    or follow the RIOXX or OpenAIREv4.1 specifications.

    example:

    Failed match example:

    A successful partial match:
    - `dc:title`: _A study of Open Access Papers in Europe_
    - PDF title: _Studying Open Access papers in Europe_

    The closer the match, the more likely we will accept the change.

    You may bypass this check by including a link to the full text
    in `dc:identifier`.
