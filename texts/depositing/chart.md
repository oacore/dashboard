title: Deposit time lag
---

The chart displays outputs' distribution according to deposit time lag.

- **Time lag** is the difference between deposit and publication date
  in the repository.
- **Publication date** is taken from the repository. When this is not available,
  it is calculated from [Crossref](https://www.crossref.org).
- **Deposit date** is calculated using specific techniques.
  On EPrints repositories it is extracted from the *Date Deposited* field,
  while on DSpace the *dc.date.available* field is used.
