The chart displays outputs' distribution according to deposit time lag.

- **Time lag** is the difference between deposit and publication date
  in the repository.
- **Publication date** is taken from [Crossref](https://www.crossref.org).
  When this is not available, the repository's one used.
- **Deposit date** is calculated using specific techniques.
  On EPrints repositories it is extracted from the *Date Deposited* field,
  while on DSpace the *dc.date.available* field is used.
